We have just released on YouTube the official recording of the validation round results of the 2nd Infodengue-Mosqlimate Dengue Challenge.

👉 Watch here: [YouTube Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YexrCASlqIE)

The webinar brought together researchers, public health professionals, and data scientists to discuss the latest advances in forecasting dengue outbreaks in the context of climate change.
The challenge aims to strengthen our ability to anticipate dengue epidemics by integrating epidemiological, climatic, and technological information to support better public health decisions.
