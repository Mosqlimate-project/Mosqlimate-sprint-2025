title = '2nd InfoDengue–Mosqlimate Dengue Challenge (IMDC): Results of the Dengue Forecast Challenge in Brazil'
+++

The second InfoDengue–Mosqlimate Dengue Challenge (IMDC) brought together researchers and modeling teams from around the world with an ambitious goal: to improve dengue outbreak forecasts in Brazil using climatic and epidemiological data.

The IMDC results presentation event highlighted major technical advances and international collaboration in tackling mosquito-borne diseases. In the first part, the presenters shared the ensemble model results, which combine forecasts from multiple approaches to generate more robust estimates of dengue cases. The discussion covered performance comparisons, uncertainty analysis, and next steps to enhance the integration of climate and epidemiological data in forecasting models.

The Mosqlimate team, organizers of the challenge, presented their modeling strategies, emphasizing how environmental and meteorological factors were incorporated to predict dengue incidence across different regions. All participating teams shared their approaches, methods, datasets, and outcomes — each showcasing innovative forecasting models that can support health authorities in anticipating outbreaks and planning preventive actions.

This event was a great opportunity to understand how climate and public health intersect through mathematical modeling and data science.
