## Second Dengue Forecast Sprint (2025)
Our dengue forecast sprint, also known  as the ***Infodengue-Mosqlimate Dengue Challenge (IMDC)***, is a yearly event that brings together researchers, data scientists, and public health professionals to forecast dengue outbreaks in Brazil. The event is organized by the [Infodengue Project](https://info.dengue.mat.br) and the [Mosqlimate Project](https://mosqlimate.org).

We held the first IMDC in 2024 with the challenge to predict dengue incidence in Brazil in 2025. This first event was a pilot that we used to establish the methodology and tools for the challenge. This year's sprint is expected to engage a much larger set of forecasters in a very exciting collective effort to understand dengue dynamics in Brasil.

The year 2024 has seen an exceptional number of reported dengue fever cases in various parts of the world. In Brazil, the disease has spread to areas in the south and at altitudes where epidemics were not previously recorded, and the incidence rate has far exceeded that of previous years. In 2025 the dengue season has not been as intense as in 2024 for most of the country, but we continue to see strong transmission throughout the country.
