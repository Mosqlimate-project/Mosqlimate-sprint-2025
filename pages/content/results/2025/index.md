## 💻 Technical Results and Documentation

Detailed documentation, including the performance metrics for individual and ensemble models, is publicly available on the project's GitHub repository:

### 1. Individual Model Validation Results

* **Repository Documentation:** The main findings, key validation metrics, and performance tables for all 19 predictive models are presented here: [https://github.com/Mosqlimate-project/2nd_IMDC_sprint_results/blob/main/readme.md](https://github.com/Mosqlimate-project/2nd_IMDC_sprint_results/blob/main/readme.md)
* **Seminar Video:** A recorded seminar detailing the initial validation results and comparative analysis is available here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YexrCASlqIE&t=1798s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YexrCASlqIE&t=1798s)

### 2. Ensemble Model Analysis

The project utilized an **ensemble model** (a combination of top-performing models) to create a potentially more robust and accurate forecast.

* **Ensemble Documentation:** The methodology and specific performance results of the ensemble are documented here: [https://github.com/Mosqlimate-project/2nd_IMDC_sprint_results/blob/main/ensemble_results.md](https://github.com/Mosqlimate-project/2nd_IMDC_sprint_results/blob/main/ensemble_results.md)
* **Ensemble Presentation:** The dedicated video presentation summarizing the ensemble results is available here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sb3lv3hGwGg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sb3lv3hGwGg)

## 📈 Official Report and Policy Scenarios

The insights derived from the ensemble modeling were used to generate the **"Relatório IMDC 2025"**, a high-impact technical report for the **Brazilian Ministry of Health**. This report provided vital **scenarios for the next dengue season (2025-2026)**, aiding public health preparedness.

* **Technical Report (Portuguese Only):** The official report detailing the seasonal scenarios is available on Zenodo: [https://zenodo.org/records/17516518](https://zenodo.org/records/17516518)

### Presentation of Report Results (Multilingual)

The seminar presenting the core results and scenarios outlined in the technical report was recorded and made available in three languages:

* **English:** [Dengue Forecasts for 2026: Results of the 2nd InfoDengue–Mosqlimate Challenge](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXTe6UC-7WM);
* **Spanish:** [Predicciones de Dengue para 2026: Resultados del 2º Desafío InfoDengue–Mosqlimate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=If_6LrGCJfs);
* **Portuguese:** [Previsões de Dengue para 2026: Resultados do 2° Desafio InfoDengue-Mosqlimate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXv7ZOci5Lw).
