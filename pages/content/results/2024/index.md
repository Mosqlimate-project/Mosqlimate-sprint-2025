## 💻 Technical Results and Documentation

Detailed documentation, including the performance metrics for individual and ensemble models, is publicly available on the project's GitHub repository:

### 1. Individual Model Validation Results

* **Repository Documentation:** The main findings, key validation metrics, and performance tables for all predictive models are presented here: [https://github.com/Mosqlimate-project/sprint-template/blob/main/scores/scores.md](https://github.com/Mosqlimate-project/sprint-template/blob/main/scores/scores.md)


### 2. Ensemble Model Analysis

The project utilized an **ensemble model** (a combination of top-performing models) to create a potentially more robust and accurate forecast.

* **Ensemble Documentation:** The methodology and specific performance results of the ensemble are documented in this paper: [Leveraging probabilistic forecasts for dengue preparedness and control: the 2024 Dengue Forecasting Sprint in Brazil](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.05.12.25327419v1).

## 📈 Official Report and Policy Scenarios

The insights derived from the ensemble modeling were used to generate the **"Relatório Técnico Infodengue"**, a high-impact technical report for the **Brazilian Ministry of Health**. This report provided vital **scenarios for the next dengue season (2024-2025)**, aiding public health preparedness.

* **Technical Report (Portuguese Only):** The official report detailing the seasonal scenarios is available on Zenodo: [https://zenodo.org/records/13929005](https://zenodo.org/records/13929005)

### Presentation of Report Results (Multilingual)

The seminar presenting the core results and scenarios outlined in the technical report was recorded and made available in three languages:

* **English:** [Preparing for the 2025 dengue season: insights from predictive models](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrgg_HIRPfI);
* **Spanish:** [Preparación para la temporada de dengue de 2025: perspectivas de los modelos predictivos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZENF-kK_VQ);
* **Portuguese:** [Preparação para a temporada de dengue 2025: perspectivas de modelos preditivos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fVgqHS-Ksk&t=3299s).
