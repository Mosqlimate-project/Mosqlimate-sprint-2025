Challenge
The year 2024 has seen an exceptional number of reported dengue fever cases globally. In Brazil, besides the high incidence, the disease has spread to areas in the south or at altitudes where epidemics were not previously recorded, or where the incidence rate has far exceeded that of previous years. In the beginning of 2025, the dengue season was not expected to be as intense as in 2024 for most of the country, but we continue to see strong transmission throughout the country."><meta name=generator content="Hugo 0.147.7"><meta name=robots content="index, follow"><link rel=stylesheet href=/ananke/css/main.min.8d048772ae72ab11245a0e296d1f2a36d3e3dd376c6c867394d6cc659c68fc37.css><link rel=stylesheet href=/css/custom.css><link rel=canonical href=https://sprint.mosqlimate.org/2025/><meta property="og:url" content="https://sprint.mosqlimate.org/2025/"><meta property="og:site_name" content="Mosqlimate - IMDC"><meta property="og:title" content="Mosqlimate - IMDC"><meta property="og:description" content="This initiative is led by the Mosqlimate and Infodengue in collaboration with the Harmonize and IDExtremes projects.
