Our dengue forecast sprint, also known  as the Infodengue-Mosqlimate Dengue Challenge (IMDC), is a yearly event that brings together researchers, data scientists, and public health professionals to forecast dengue outbreaks in Brazil. The event is organized by the Infodengue Project and the Mosqlimate Project.
The year 2024 has seen an exceptional number of reported dengue fever cases in various parts of the world. In Brazil, the disease has spread to areas in the south and at altitudes where epidemics were not previously recorded, and the incidence rate has far exceeded that of previous years. In 2025 the dengue season has not been as intense as in 2024 for most of the country, but we continue to see strong transmission throughout the country."><meta name=generator content="Hugo 0.143.1"><meta name=robots content="index, follow"><link rel=stylesheet href=/ananke/css/main.min.d05fb5f317fcf33b3a52936399bdf6f47dc776516e1692e412ec7d76f4a5faa2.css><link rel=canonical href=https://sprint.mosqlimate.org/2025/><meta property="og:url" content="https://sprint.mosqlimate.org/2025/"><meta property="og:site_name" content="Mosqlimate - Sprint"><meta property="og:title" content="Save the date in 2025"><meta property="og:description" content="2025 Dengue Forecast Sprint Our dengue forecast sprint, also known as the Infodengue-Mosqlimate Dengue Challenge (IMDC), is a yearly event that brings together researchers, data scientists, and public health professionals to forecast dengue outbreaks in Brazil.
