predictions;</p></li><li><p>Continuously update and monitor model performance.</p></li></ul><p>To facilitate model development, the Mosqlimate platform compiled a comprehensive dataset integrating epidemiological, demographic, and climate data. It also provided a GitHub-based submission template to standardize and aggregate forecasts into an ensemble model.</p><p>Six teams participated in the first edition of the Sprint, presenting predictive models during a workshop held on August 16.
