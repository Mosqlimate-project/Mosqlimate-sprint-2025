Important Dates:

Release of the announcement - June 20, 2024
Forecast submission deadline - August 16th, 2024
Presentation of participant’s models - August 16th, 2024
Presentation of the ensemble model- August 30th, 2024

Organization
This initiative is led by the Mosqlimate project, in collaboration with the Harmonize and IDExtremes projects.
Challenge
The year 2024 has seen an exceptional number of reported dengue fever cases in various parts of the world. In Brazil, the disease has spread to areas in the south and at altitudes where epidemics were not previously recorded, and the incidence rate has far exceeded that of previous years. The objective of this sprint is to promote, in a standardized way, the training of predictive models with the aim of developing an ensemble forecast for dengue in Brazil."><meta name=generator content="Hugo 0.152.2"><meta name=robots content="index, follow"><link rel=stylesheet href=/ananke/css/main.min.efe4d852f731d5d1fbb87718387202a97aafd768cdcdaed0662bbe6982e91824.css><link rel=stylesheet href=/css/custom.css><link rel=canonical href=https://sprint.mosqlimate.org/sprint/2024/><meta property="og:url" content="https://sprint.mosqlimate.org/sprint/2024/"><meta property="og:site_name" content="Mosqlimate - IMDC"><meta property="og:title" content="Sprint 2024"><meta property="og:description" content="2024 Infodengue Sprint: Dengue Fever Predictive Modeling in Brazil

The upload code will check the formatting before submission. Code and data must be available for independent analysis.</p></li><li><p>Data Sharing: Participants may use other data sources as long as they share them with other participants through the organizers.
